# Personal Projects
This repository contains directories for different projects that I take on. As projects are added, this file will be updated with a brief description of each. For questions regarding any files in this repo, feel free to contact me by email at chong02@berkeley.edu.

## Keenan
Directory devoted to the modelling project completed while working with AP Keenan Summer 2022. The final report was completed as a Jupyter Notebook but was exported as a pdf and an html file. Each are included in the directory. The main goal of the project was to create a model to help predict yearly healthcare costs from 36 months of past claims experience data. Data included in the project has been modified or deleted to ensure protection of sensitive/proprietary data.

## Web Development
Directory devoted to any/all web development projects. Currently nothing of much substance as I'm still in the learning process.
