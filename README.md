# Personal Projects
This repository contains directories for different projects that I take on. As projects are added, this file will be updated with a brief description of each.

## Comida for Familias
Directory devoted to the mini-project completed for the Comida for Familias competition.

## Keenan
Directory devoted to the modelling project completed while working with AP Keenan Summer 2022. The final report was completed as a Jupyter Notebook but was exported as a pdf and an html file. Each are included in the directory. The main goal of the project was to create a model to help predict yearly healthcare costs from 36 months of past claims experience data.

## Web Development
Directory devoted to any/all web development projects.
